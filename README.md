# Loan-Data-Analysis

Loan Data Analysis | SQL, Tableau

This project leverages SQL on MySQL Server and Tableau for the analysis and visualization of financial loan data, specifically focusing on the Prosper Loan Dataset. The primary goal is to extract key insights into loan performance and borrower behavior by calculating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) across Loan Portfolio Metrics, Financial Performance, and Borrower Metrics. The project involves the creation of a MySQL database, where the dataset is loaded using the "data local infile" method for efficient processing. Complex SQL queries are employed to compute various metrics, such as loan distribution, default rates, repayment patterns, and financial outcomes.

Once the data is processed, it is exported in CSV format and imported into Tableau, where it is transformed into a set of interactive visualizations. These visualizations provide clear, actionable insights into the loan data, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions. The final output is a comprehensive Tableau Dashboard that showcases the performance metrics in a visually engaging manner, allowing for a deeper understanding of the financial landscape.

## Steps:

1. Data acquisition from the Prosper Loan Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nurudeenabdulsalaam/prosper-loan-dataset).
2. Creating the loan_data table in MySQL for data storage.
3. Importing the dataset into MySQL via the LOAD DATA INFILE method.
4. Calculating KPI metrics such as Financial Performance, Borrower Metrics, and Loan Portfolio Metrics using advanced SQL techniques.
5. Exporting processed data loan_data to CSV and importing it into Tableau.
6. Creating dynamic and informative visualizations in Tableau.
